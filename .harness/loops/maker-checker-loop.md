# Maker-Checker Loop

A self-contained build/verify cycle that needs no human in the round. The Maker implements; the Checker (a separate invocation, so it cannot see the Maker's rationalizations) verifies against acceptance + rubric; feedback loops back until N consecutive passes or max rounds. This is `roles.md` turned into an automated cycle, and it is the loop `graph/workflow-graph.md` draws.

## Components

### Maker prompt (skeleton)
```
You are the Maker. Implement ONLY the active feature in .harness/ROADMAP.md.
Read: AGENTS.md, the feature's sprint-contract.md, architecture docs, layer-boundaries.md, scope-guard.md.
Build the thinnest step that advances the feature. Produce the evidence each acceptance item needs.
Obey boundaries and scope. Do NOT grade your own work. Do NOT mark the feature passed.
Output: what you changed, the exact commands to reproduce evidence, any contract deviation.
```

### Checker prompt (skeleton)
```
You are the Checker. You did not write this code. Do not trust the Maker's summary.
Re-run every verification command yourself. Score against .harness/verification/evaluator-rubric.md.
Check acceptance completeness, correctness (incl. edge/error paths), boundary+scope compliance,
modularity, evidence quality. Look for the skipped item, the empty assertion, the boundary leak.
Output: the scored block + verdict PASS|REVISE. On REVISE, list specific defects tied to
acceptance items / rubric lines with the failing evidence. Do not fix code.
```

### State file
`loop-state.md` — tracks round number, what the Maker changed, the Checker verdict + defects, and the consecutive-pass counter.

## Cycle
```
round r:
  Maker implements  ->  writes evidence + change summary  ->  updates loop-state
  Checker re-runs checks  ->  scores  ->  verdict
    PASS   -> consecutivePasses++ ; if >= REQUIRED_PASSES -> mark feature passed, exit
    REVISE -> consecutivePasses=0 ; record defects ; Maker addresses them next round
  if r >= MAX_ROUNDS -> stop, escalate to human with the standing defects
```

## Parameters (defaults; tune per feature in loop-state.md)
- `REQUIRED_PASSES = 2` consecutive Checker PASSes (guards against a fluke green).
- `MAX_ROUNDS = 6`.
- Escalate immediately (do not spend rounds) on: a boundary violation the Maker keeps reintroducing, or a request that needs a human decision (a hard-stop in AGENTS.md).

## Why a separate Checker invocation
If the same context grades itself, it inherits the Maker's blind spots and its motivation to be done. A cold Checker re-running the commands is the whole point. When run inside one session, switch context hard and re-run — do not "remember" that it worked.
