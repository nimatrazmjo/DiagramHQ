# PR Review Loop

Runs after maker-checker passes and `record` writes evidence. Local checks + a self-scored rubric are not the same as a diff a reviewer actually looked at. This loop closes that gap: it gates moving to the next feature on a clean PR, not just a clean local run.

## Cycle
```
after record (feature passed maker-checker):
  push branch to origin
  open a PR if none exists for this branch (reuse if one does — never open a second)
  review the PR (code-review skill; a Checker-style pass over the diff, not self-grading)
    CLEAN  -> exit loop, proceed to next feature / handoff
    ISSUES -> fix (Maker) -> commit -> push (same branch/PR) -> review again
  if issues persist for MAX_PR_ROUNDS -> escalate to human with standing findings
```

## Components

`<branch>` below is `feat/<FID>` for a ROADMAP feature, or `docs/<slug>`/`chore/<slug>` for harness-only tooling work (`rules/conventions.md`'s branch-naming exception). `<name>` is the FID, or the branch's slug for harness-only work.

### Push
`git push -u origin <branch>` (plain `git push` once upstream is set). Never force-push a shared branch.

### Open / reuse PR
`gh pr create --base main --head <branch> --title "<type>(<scope>): <desc>"` — title follows the commit convention (`rules/conventions.md`). Body is the write-up already conventional at `.harness/reviews/<name>-PR.md` (see `F001-PR.md`, `F006-PR.md`) — write that file first, pass it as `--body-file`. Check `gh pr list --head <branch>` before creating; if one is open, push updates to it instead.

### Review
Run the `code-review` skill against the branch/PR diff. Same principle as the Checker in `maker-checker-loop.md`: it must not just trust the Maker's summary of its own diff. Record findings in `.harness/reviews/<name>-review.md` (existing convention; see `pr-review-loop-review.md` for a harness-only example).

### Fix
Findings get addressed as the Maker, committed, and pushed to the same branch — never a new PR, never a force-push. Then review again.

## Parameters
- `MAX_PR_ROUNDS = 4` (a round here is push+review+fix, not a full maker-checker cycle — keep it separate from `MAX_ROUNDS` in `maker-checker-loop.md`).

## Gate
The next feature does not start (`plan` for the next FID) until the current feature's PR is clean. This is `AGENTS.md` rule 2 ("one feature at a time") extended past the local check to the PR — a feature that passed maker-checker but has an open PR with unresolved findings is not done.

## Why after record, not before
Maker-checker already proves correctness + evidence locally. Doing the PR after `record` means every PR opened describes a feature already proven, not a WIP diff — the PR review is one more independent pass (real GitHub checks, a fresh look at the diff), not a substitute for the local one.
