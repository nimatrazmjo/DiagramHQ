# Implementation Changelog

Every completed feature and every meaningful state change is recorded here, newest first. Each entry names a feature ID (or the tracking system). No vague entries. A feature appears here as COMPLETE only after verification. (Supersedes the earlier `state/claude-progress.md`, archived under `_archive/`.)

## 2026-09-25 — Tracking system established

Status: COMPLETE (tracking setup; not a product feature)

Implemented:
- Persistent implementation tracking system inside `.harness/`: PROJECT_STATE.md (master), ROADMAP.md (135 features across 13 phases, permanent F-IDs), CURRENT_TASK.md, CHANGELOG.md, DECISIONS.md, BLOCKERS.md, and phases/PHASE-01..13.md.
- Adopted the 13-phase F001–F108 taxonomy (+ F109–F135 for master-spec items not in the reference list); carried the acceptance criteria + tests from the retired feature_list.json into the phase files.
- Made the Markdown tracking system the single source of truth; archived the superseded feature_list.json, session-handoff.md, FEATURE_MATRIX.md, and claude-progress.md under `_archive/`.

Files: `.harness/PROJECT_STATE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `CURRENT_TASK.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `BLOCKERS.md`, `phases/*` (+ repointed AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md/README.md/scope-guard.md/PRODUCT.md and scripts/SCRIPTS.md).

Verification:
- Structure: 6 master files + 13 phase files present.
- ROADMAP counts: 135 features, 0 complete, progress 0.0%.
- No application code in the repo (all features correctly NOT STARTED).

Notes: No product feature implemented — this was the tracking-system task. Product build begins at F001.

## 2026-09-25 — Harness bootstrap (history)

Status: COMPLETE

Implemented (before the tracking system):
- Created the `.harness/` rules + spec system from the 8 Learn-Harness-Engineering projects: entry points, product/, architecture/ (+ 3 ADRs), rules/, verification/, loops/, graph/, scripts/.
- Wrote the DiagramHQ product spec and the initial 6-phase feature checklist (later restructured into the 13-phase ROADMAP above).

Verification: harness tree present; no application code.

Notes: Retained for history. The 6-phase feature_list.json from this work is archived under `_archive/`.
