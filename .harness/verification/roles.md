# Roles — Separation of Duties

The single biggest reliability lever is not a smarter model; it is separating who builds from who judges. When one agent plans, builds, and grades itself, it declares victory early. Splitting the work into roles that hand off with evidence removes that failure. (In the harness-engineering benchmark, one self-reviewing role scored ~1.6/5; planner+generator+evaluator scored ~4.9/5. The roles are the difference.)

You play these roles in sequence, switching context deliberately. Announce the switch ("Now acting as Evaluator") so it is visible and you do not blur them.

## Planner
- Input: the active feature in `ROADMAP.md`, the product/architecture docs, the handoff.
- Output: a filled `sprint-contract.md` — scope, acceptance mapped to checks, the plan, out-of-scope list, risks. Nothing is built until the contract exists.
- Discipline: the Planner decides *what done means* before the Generator can be tempted to redefine it mid-build.

## Generator (maker)
- Input: the signed sprint contract.
- Output: the implementation, plus the evidence each acceptance item calls for.
- Discipline: builds only what the contract says. Discovers scope creep? Parks it, does not build it. Produces the evidence; does not grade it.

## Evaluator (checker)
- Input: the contract + the Generator's output + evidence. **Does not trust the Generator's summary — re-runs the checks.**
- Output: a score against `evaluator-rubric.md`, a defect list, and a verdict: PASS or REVISE.
- Discipline: independent and adversarial-in-good-faith. Looks for the acceptance item that was quietly skipped, the test that asserts nothing, the "passed" with no evidence, the boundary violation. The Evaluator may not fix code; it reports. A vague "looks good" is a failed evaluation.

## Handoff rules
- Generator -> Evaluator handoff must include: what was built, the exact commands to reproduce evidence, and any deviation from the contract.
- Evaluator -> Generator (on REVISE) must include: specific defects, each tied to an acceptance item or rubric line, and the failing evidence.
- A feature is `passed` only after an Evaluator PASS with score >= threshold. The Generator cannot set `passed` on its own say-so.

## When roles run as one agent vs. separate agents
- Same session, sequential: acceptable for most features. Switch context explicitly; re-run checks with fresh eyes.
- Separate agent/loop (`loops/maker-checker-loop.md`): preferred for risky or large features, and for the automated loop. The checker is a different invocation so it cannot see the maker's rationalizations.

## Anti-patterns (an automatic REVISE)
- Grading your own work by assertion.
- "Tests pass" without showing which tests and their output.
- Marking passed to move on, intending to "come back to it."
- Evaluator softening a defect to avoid another round.
