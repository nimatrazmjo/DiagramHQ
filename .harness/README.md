# DiagramHQ Harness

This is the **harness** for building DiagramHQ, a model-first architecture intelligence platform (a better-than-IcePanel Architecture OS). A harness gives the model a closed-loop working system so it builds the right thing, verifies its own work, and — through the persistent tracking system below — survives across sessions without relying on conversation history.

**There is no application code here.** This folder is a persistent tracking system + rules + specs. A coding agent reads it, then writes the app one verified feature at a time.

## Read order (every session starts here)
1. `PROJECT_STATE.md` — **MASTER FILE.** Where the project is. Read this before anything.
2. `CURRENT_TASK.md` — the one feature to work on next.
3. `ROADMAP.md` — all 135 features across 13 phases, with status.
4. The active `phases/PHASE-XX-*.md` — acceptance criteria.
5. `DECISIONS.md` + `BLOCKERS.md`, then inspect the real code.

```

## The tracking system (why it exists)
The project must not depend on chat history to know what's done. `PROJECT_STATE.md` answers "where am I?", `ROADMAP.md` answers "where am I going?", `CURRENT_TASK.md` answers "what do I do now?". After implementing and verifying, the agent updates the tracking files and picks the next task. A brand-new session can enter the repo and continue with no prior context.

## How this maps to harness engineering
Built from the eight *Learn Harness Engineering* projects (walkinglabs.github.io/learn-harness-engineering): rules-first entry points (`AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`/`rules/`), an agent-readable workspace (this tree), multi-session continuity (`PROJECT_STATE.md`/`ROADMAP.md`/`CURRENT_TASK.md`/`CHANGELOG.md`), runtime feedback + scope control (`rules/` + `scripts/`), self-verification + role separation (`verification/`), the complete observable harness (this README + `scripts/`), automated loops (`loops/`), and the workflow drawn as a graph (`graph/`).

## First target
**Phase 01 — Foundation, feature F001 — Project architecture.** Stand up the monorepo and make `init` green. See `CURRENT_TASK.md`.
